My final project topic is Reversi which is a chess game with both black and white disc on a 8x8 board. The aim of this game is to maximize the 

number of your own color disc on the board. The mechanic of this game is to encircle your opponent discs to turn them into your own color.

This game consist of two parts, one is playing Reversi against another player. The other is beating the AI. Algorithm of optimization in each step has 

been implemented in the script for AI. Two main function has been made in which the function 'reversi' is the backbone of the whole game. This function 

is used to ensure the flow of the game is smooth. At the same time, there are several which is used for (1)checking whether the input is valid

(2)Count the number of discs for each player every single round    (3)Updating the board for processing the game without abnormality.

   On the other hand, the AI program also has several functions to determine which position is the most benefitial. For instance, it has function to 

minimize the choice of places for player's next move. Also, the AI will be guided to take the tactical points if possible while avoiding stepping on

the positions.
